## Final course project   :mortar_board:
  
` EDIT: April-06-21 - I refactored the code using OOP `  
This was my first project ever made. Before I even learned OOP.\
This was for my first year, first semester, C#, final project. We had different options between which project to choose, I guess I was choosing Minesweeper because it felt like an interesting challenge.


## Build Status

The game currently has 2 options:
